# Building your portfolio

In this lesson

* You identify three subjects to write a blog post or web page on
* They can be from the previous weeks at Lambda School, or something you are interested that we haven't covered.
* You use the template provided in today's Coding Challenge to begin work on each post
* You write stubs and/or outlines for each post.
* You produce assets for each post: Math, graphs, and Creative Commons images from images.google.com
* You _produce_ these posts, either on Medium or through your web site
* You remember that nothing (usually) on the internet is permanent. If you don't feel like your posts are production quality yet, you produce them anyway! You will have time to either: update them to production quality or: delete them after you've begun producing better material (later in this course).
